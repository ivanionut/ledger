This started as a side project to learn git, lucee, mysql, and docker.  I relaced the checkbook app I originally wrote in PHP with this version.  This repo contains the entire stack I'm using including the app, a container for the database, a test database for integration tests, phpmyadmin, and others.  To deploy locally, create a .env file with all required variables and run a docker-compose up command.

While I do use this app personally (deployed on a local linux server), it's basically a playground to test out ideas on.
